Currently, in development.

## Sprites

In this project, sprites are directly sourced from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
The `PokeApiClient` class within the project is responsible for fetching data from the PokéAPI.

## Note
Please note that as the game is still in development, some features might not be fully implemented, and you may encounter bugs.

### Accessing the Game

Can only be played by cloning this repository. Once the development is complete, I will release a downloadable version of the game, 
making it easier for everyone to access and enjoy!
