# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator

Pokémon Battle Simulator: A dynamic two-player game where players select their Pokémon teams and battle against each other. 
Built with JavaFX, this project offers an interactive gaming experience, emphasizing strategy and player choice. 
Currently, in development.

## Core Features

- **Team Selection:** Choose your team from a diverse roster of Pokémon, each with its unique abilities and stats.
- **Do It Yourself** Create each Pokémon individually, by choosing its ability, moves, EVs and more !
- **Battles:** Engage in exciting battles that unfold just like in the real game, offering a blend of strategy and fun.

## Introducing a Game-Changing Feature

### Unlimited Move Sets
One of the standout features of my Pokémon Battle Simulator is the **Unlimited Move Sets** mechanic. 
Unlike traditional Pokémon games, where each Pokémon is limited to moves within its move pool, this game breaks these boundaries. 
Here, **every Pokémon can learn any move**, giving players unmatched freedom to customize their team's strategy and synergy.

## Sprites

In this project, sprites are directly sourced from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
The `PokeApiClient` class within the project is responsible for fetching data from the PokéAPI.

## Note
Please note that as the game is still in development, some features might not be fully implemented, and you may encounter bugs.

### Accessing the Game

Can only be played by cloning this repository. Once the development is complete, I will release a downloadable version of the game, 
making it easier for everyone to access and enjoy!

### Feedback & Suggestions
